### **Step 7: Create Admin User**

After deployment, you'll need to create an admin user. Railway will show you the deployment logs. Look for a command like:

```bash
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### **Step 8: Access Your Live Site**

Your site will be available at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

- **Main site:** `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- **Admin panel:** `https://your-app-name.railway.app/admin`
